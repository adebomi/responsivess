        <h2>I received a job offer mid-course , and the subjects i learned were current, if not more so, in the company i joined. I honestly feel i got every penny's worth.</h1>
        <p>I was an EMT for many years before i joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it credibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best-and most grueling-time of my life. Since completing the course. I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR Startup.   </p>
